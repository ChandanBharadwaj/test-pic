For a Kubernetes Job with a single pod that dynamically adjusts memory allocation based on runtime needs, you can achieve this with **Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)**. Here's how you can configure it:

---

### **Step 1: Define a Job with Resource Requests and Limits**
Start by defining a Kubernetes Job that specifies initial memory requests and limits. These serve as a baseline for VPA to adjust.

**`spring-boot-job.yaml`**:
```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: spring-boot-job
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: spring-boot-job
        image: spring-boot-job:latest
        imagePullPolicy: Never
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "512Mi" # Minimum memory required
            cpu: "500m"
          limits:
            memory: "1Gi"   # Maximum memory allowed initially
            cpu: "1"
      restartPolicy: Never
```

Apply the Job:
```bash
kubectl apply -f spring-boot-job.yaml
```

---

### **Step 2: Enable Vertical Pod Autoscaler**
Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) adjusts resource requests and limits based on actual usage. Follow these steps:

#### 1. **Install VPA**
If not already installed, deploy the Vertical Pod Autoscaler in your cluster:
```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/releases/latest/download/vertical-pod-autoscaler.yaml
```

Verify VPA components are running:
```bash
kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep vpa
```

---

#### 2. **Create a VPA Resource**
Define a VPA configuration for your Job's pod. This will allow Kubernetes to increase the memory allocation as needed.

**`vpa.yaml`**:
```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling.k8s.io/v1
kind: VerticalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: spring-boot-job-vpa
spec:
  targetRef:
    apiVersion: batch/v1
    kind: Job
    name: spring-boot-job
  updatePolicy:
    updateMode: "Auto" # Automatically adjusts resource requests and limits
```

Apply the VPA resource:
```bash
kubectl apply -f vpa.yaml
```

---

### **Step 3: Monitor VPA Adjustments**
The VPA will monitor the resource usage of your Job's pod and dynamically adjust the memory requests and limits based on actual usage.

- **Check Recommendations:**
  ```bash
  kubectl describe vpa spring-boot-job-vpa
  ```
  This will show the current memory and CPU adjustments made by the VPA.

- **View Logs:**
  Use `kubectl logs` to check if your Spring Boot application behaves as expected with the adjusted memory.

---

### **Step 4: Clean Up Resources**
Once your Job completes, you can delete the resources:
```bash
kubectl delete job spring-boot-job
kubectl delete vpa spring-boot-job-vpa
```

---

### **Additional Notes**
1. **Ensure Proper Testing**:
   Test the memory adjustments in a staging environment to ensure the application performs well under dynamic memory conditions.

2. **Avoid Limits for Unlimited Memory**:
   If you don't want a memory cap, you can omit the `limits` section in your Job manifest. This allows the container to use as much memory as required, limited only by the node's capacity.

3. **Combine with Resource Monitoring**:
   Use `kubectl top pod` or a monitoring tool like Prometheus and Grafana to track memory usage over time.
